### 3D Print Your Brain from T1 weighted MRI data
#### This guide aims to be the complete tutorial on how to get your T1 weighted image from a ".nii.gz" format into a handy ".stl" file format. I have tried my best to make the script run on every OS.
Despite my occasional genius I would not have gotten as far as I did, without the help of people that came before me. So as a responsible developer I think it only tell you check out these repositories as they have assisted my each in their own unique way.
